# terminal_chess
Chess engine, to be played on the terminal.

A project started by rookie Hans Hofner.
With around two years of course experience of C and C++, I wanted to tackle a project that will challenge me.
I love playing chess and thought this would be a great way of applying the set of skills that I have learned from the book.
